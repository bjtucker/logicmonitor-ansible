### Ansible Module Specifications

```
module: logicmonitor
short_description: Manage your LogicMonitor account through Ansible Playbooks
description:
    - LogicMonitor is a hosted, full-stack,
      infrastructure monitoring platform.
    - This module manages hosts, host groups, and collectors within your
      LogicMonitor account.
version_added: "2.1"
author: Ethan Culler-Mayeno, Jeff Wozniak
notes: You must have an existing LogicMonitor account for this module to      
       function.
requirements:
    - An existing LogicMonitor account
    - Currently supported operating systems:
        - Linux
options:
    target:
        description:
            - The type of LogicMonitor object you wish to manage.
            - "Collector" Perform actions on a LogicMonitor collector
            - "Host" Perform actions on a host device
            - "Hostgroup"  Perform actions on a LogicMonitor host group
            - NOTE Host and Hostgroup tasks should always be performed via
              local_action. There are no benefits to running these tasks on
              the remote host and doing so will typically cause problems.
            - NOTE Collector tasks require superuser access for
              starting/stopping services. Be sure to run these tasks as root
              or set 'become: yes' for the task.
